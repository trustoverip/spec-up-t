 * @fileoverview Styles for the definition buttons container that holds both

 * @version 2.0.0

 * @updated 2025-10-02 - Refactored from float to flexbox for better responsiveness
 * @description This CSS file provides the styling for a container that groups
 * multiple control buttons in definition list terms (dt elements). The container
 * uses flexbox within a flex parent (the dt) for proper responsive alignment.

 * Container that holds both definition control buttons.
 * Uses flexbox for proper alignment and spacing of child buttons.
 * Positioned using flex properties instead of float for better responsiveness.
 * The parent dt element uses flexbox, so this container is a flex item.
