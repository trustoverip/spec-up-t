- All code will have to pass SonarQube analysis
- Cognitive complexity should be kept ideally below 15
- Remove code if possible, instead of adding code
- If you create files, explain why they are not deleted, why they should stay, and how to use them
- This repository runs as an npm package in other repos that have this package installed via `package.json`; these other repos thus are the consuming projects
- When working on client side JS or CSS (in `assets`), please remind me to run `gulp compile`
- When using the term `tref` we mean this construction: `[[tref: externalreference, term, alias]]`
- When using the term `xref` we mean this construction: `[[tref: externalreference, term]]`
- When using the term `def` we mean this construction: `[[def: term, alias]]`
- Be generous with writing explanations for each block of code
- Please remind me to test on a separate testmachine
